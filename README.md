# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use a machine learning model to find if the funds allocated from Alphabet Soup are being used properly by the recipients. Specifically, we used our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks to find which of the companies would be successful if they received funding through Alphabet Soup.
## Results
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  - The column "IS_SUCCESSFUL" if considered the target for this model.
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  - The model uses all other columns in the encoded_application_df to be the features of the model
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  - The columns "EIN" and "NAME" were removed from the initial applications data frame as they were neither targets or variables
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
